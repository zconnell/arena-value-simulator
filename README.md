# arena-value-simulator
A simple simulation of Magic Arena draft events so players can evaluate their best option.
At present time (2020.07.01), Magic Arena contains two primary limited event types:
  Best-of-1 (BO1): Players play single games until they reach either 7 wins or 3 losses.
  Best-of-3 (BO3): Players play matches that are best 2-out-of-3 games. Players play 3 matches regardless of record.
Both events cost 1500 Gems to enter, but prize payouts for these events are very different.

Currently, this contains two files:
1. ArenaSimulator.py - Python program to simulate playing events in Magic Arena.
2. simulations.json - The output file of the ArenaSimulator.
